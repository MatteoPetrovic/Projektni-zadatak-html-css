            <h1> Manson Guitar Works - History</h1>

                <figcaption><span>Hugh Manson has been making custom guitars for over 30 years and has earned an enviable reputation within the music industry for innovation and quality. A craftsman and perfectionist Hugh combines technology with inspiring materials to create unique instruments for musicians around the world.</span></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The current Manson Guitar Works facility can trace its roots all the way back to the 60s when Hugh’s brother, Andy Manson, decided to build his first acoustic guitar aged just 17. Andy later studied at the London College of Furniture in 1968/69 where lectures in the science of soundboards became of particular interest. Andy developed his passion into a guitar repair/building business specialising in acoustic instruments such as mandolas, bouzoukis, and other folk instruments.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t long after this that Andy’s younger brother Hugh joined the scene deciding to specialise in the electric side of guitar making. </p>
            <p>This was to become the first foundations of the current <span class="manson">Manson Guitar Works.</span></p>
            <p>The 1970s was a decade of development, the very earliest Merlin guitars harking back to the very late seventies. It wasn’t long before customer needs were refined into two categories; those that demanded an extreme one-off design that could allow the player to perform music that no other guitar could, and those that saw the value of a UK designed guitar that could be up specced with a series of options to give what we now like to call a ‘production custom’.</p>
            <p>The eighties was a period of both massive expansion and great change in the Manson Guitars world. A new slogan - GUITARS FROM THE WOOD - appeared with a tweaked logo. Our team is headed by guitar luthier Hugh Manson and bass expert Adrian Ashton. A book of recorded serial numbers for each and every guitar that was produced shows the company at this time had a full order book and a diverse range of instruments in production. During the early years of the decade there were a great number of international artists with instruments either in build or under discussion, from John Paul Jones, Jack Bruce, Jeff Beck to punk bands such as Anti-Nowhere League and session players such as John Currie!</p>
            <p>One of the most important custom builds at this time was the Manson 'De Lorean', built for Matthew Bellamy from Muse. A unique instrument developed jointly by Hugh and Matt which featured muliple unique circuits installed with the help of electronics genius Ron Joyce. The name of the guitar was derived from the aluminium finish used to coat both the guitar and the famous car made by De Lorean Motors which featured in the 'Back To The Future' films.</p>
            <p>Today Manson Guitar Works produces a range of instruments from our current ‘production custom’, the MA and E-series, to one-off dream guitars you might find on stages as small as the local club or as grand as Wembley Arena! </p>
